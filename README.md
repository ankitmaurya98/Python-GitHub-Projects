# Python-Projects
 This repository contains the project folders and code for the various Python projects that I have done.

Description of the various projects that are inlcuded in this repository:

Project_MatrixCalculator: This project is a practice project that works with matricies without using numpy. It contains self made functions in order to accomplish matrix math. This project was used as a practice project to help work with classes, modules, and python arrays.

Project_BookInventorySystem: This project is a practice project in which a "database" is created of books and functions can be performed on those books.
